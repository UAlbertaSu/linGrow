# Project Requriements 

## Executive Summary 

> linGrow, offers help for bilingual and multilingual children's development to achieve their potential and provides services through facilitated communication between parents, teachers, and researchers. Teachers in different schools are able to invite parents as a group and communicate with parents fluently with a built-in translation function in more than 15 languages. The application itself will adapt to more than 15 languages. In order to support multilingual families, there are study guides for simple English for children and parents who want to get better participation in their children's studies.

### Supplemental Data

#### Bergamot Google Microsoft BLEU score comparison:

- Bergamot’s quality is slightly worse than Google and Microsoft, who got similar BLEU scores

#### Amazon Microsoft Google human and metric comparison:

- https://anno-ai.medium.com/evaluating-machine-translation-providers-68b8430debc3
- *“We were surprised to discover that the three providers showed comparable performance, and none really emerged as a clear winner. Although AWS slightly edged out the others in three out of four languages as scored by the metrics means, GCP received the highest human ratings in three out of four languages. Azure scored lower in metrics means (except in Chinese) and human ratings, but showed the lowest standard deviation across languages, indicating more consistency in translation quality.”*

#### Quick comparison of open source MT services:

- Generally slightly worse than the commercial systems 
- *“Open-source engines perform in the 2nd tier of commercial systems, except for en-es (on par with top-tier systems) and en-ko & en-ja (much worse than commercial systems).“*

## Open-source Projects

### LibreTranslate

- Open source translation API
- Easy to use, but likely a big headache to integrate, since it exists on a pre-existing system. 

### Moses

- Open source translation system that utilizes statistical methods 
- Strays very close to ML since it requires the training of the model. 
- Complex model but should provide a better and more accurate translation than the API.

### Apertium
 
- Is a free/open-source platform for developing rule-based machine translation systems!
- Will most likely give us the best translation since the developers (us) set the rule for how each language syntax should be formed. 
- The most work to use in terms of setting everything up. If we need at least 40 languages, that's 40 rules we have to write up. 
- Not recommended.
