This language barrier would often prevent teachers from consulting with parents about their children\u2019s needs, and researchers from gaining a full understanding of bilingual development. LinGrow is the novel web app solution designed to bridge this gap between multilingual families and teachers/researchers. The heart of the LinGrow app is a messaging functionality between parents and teachers, with built-in translation supporting over 40 languages. This facilitates fast and easy communication between both parties, without the hassle of running everything through a separate service, or having the child relay and translate all information. To provide further support, LinGrow provides several built-in language development activities and simple English Guidelines to assist multilingual families. LinGrow aims to create a bridge of communication between parents, researchers and teachers, to overcome the language barrier and help children achieve their full potential.

Although AWS slightly edged out the others in three out of four languages as scored by the metrics means, GCP received the highest human ratings in three out of four languages. Azure scored lower in metrics means (except in Chinese) and human ratings, but showed the lowest standard deviation across languages, indicating more consistency in translation quality.\u201d 2021 State of Machine Translation Report: Quick comparison of open source MT services: Generally slightly worse than the commercial systems \u201cOpen-source engines perform in the 2nd tier of commercial systems, except for en-es (on par with top-tier systems) and en-ko & en-ja (much worse than commercial systems).\u201c Open-source Projects LibreTranslate Open source translation API Easy to use, but likely a big headache to integrate, since it exists on a pre-existing system. Moses Open source translation system that utilizes statistical methods Strays very close to ML since it requires the training of the model. Complex model but should provide a better and more accurate translation than the API. Apertium Is a free/open-source platform for developing rule-based machine translation systems! Will most likely give us the best translation since the developers (us) set the rule for how each language syntax should be formed. The most work to use in terms of setting everything up. If we need at least 40 languages, that's 40 rules we have to write up. Not recommended.
