This language barrier would often prevent teachers from consulting with parents about their children\u2019s needs, and researchers from gaining a full understanding of bilingual development. LinGrow is the novel web app solution designed to bridge this gap between multilingual families and teachers/researchers. The heart of the LinGrow app is a messaging functionality between parents and teachers, with built-in translation supporting over 40 languages. This facilitates fast and easy communication between both parties, without the hassle of running everything through a separate service, or having the child relay and translate all information. To provide further support, LinGrow provides several built-in language development activities and simple English Guidelines to assist multilingual families. LinGrow aims to create a bridge of communication between parents, researchers and teachers, to overcome the language barrier and help children achieve their full potential.

Although AWS slightly edged out the others in three out of four languages as scored by the metrics means, GCP received the highest human ratings in three out of four languages. Azure scored lower in metrics means (except in Chinese) and human ratings, but showed the lowest standard deviation across languages, indicating more consistency in translation quality.\u201d 2021 State of Machine Translation Report: Quick comparison of open source MT services: Generally slightly worse than the commercial systems \u201cOpen-source engines perform in the 2nd tier of commercial systems, except for en-es (on par with top-tier systems) and en-ko & en-ja (much worse than commercial systems).\u201c Open-source Projects LibreTranslate Open source translation API Uses open source translation engine to power the translation (Argos Translate.) Easy to use, but requires the purchase of API key that is a monthly payment of ~$18/month. Cost may be expensive since it is a monthly payment, rather than a translation count like most services. Moses Open source translation system that utilizes statistical methods Strays very close to ML since it requires the training of the model. Complex model but should provide a better and more accurate translation than the API. method not recommended since it is a complex system and may be hard to expand later (adding more languages) Apertium Is a free/open-source platform for developing rule-based machine translation systems! Will most likely give the best translation since the developers set the rule for how each language syntax should be formed. The most work to use in terms of setting everything up.

October 4, 2022 12:00 PM - 12:44 PM Google Meet Agenda Update the result of Sprint 1 to the clients. Inform clients of the group's plan for the Sprint 2. Attendee Dr. Andrea McLeod (Client) Dr. Catrine Demers (Client) Kevin Steve Loyal Sam Scott Kash Minutes Sprint 1 Review Reviewed the documentation delivered for the Sprint 1, and received feedback. Walked through the low-fidelity wireframe UI with client, informing clients about functionalities that our groups have planned for the linGrow. Sprint 2 Preview Confirmed with clients on what they can expect as the result of Sprint 2. Feedback - Activities Activities should not be exclusive to the parent users. Parents' hub can be simplified with just chatroom accesses and activities. Parent, teachers, researchers should have access to simple English guidelines, as well as reminders to write in simple English. Feedback - Would Like but Won't Have Parents can invite/communicate with teachers. Parents can communicate with admins. Admins may be able to invite teachers and parents, register them even if they are outside of any registered schools. May create a separate \u201cclass\u201d or database built for students not enrolled in a registered school. Feedback - Parent/Children Database Schema We should account for many-to-many relationship with parents and children. Many parents or guardians (father, mother, etc.) may be associated with single child, or multiple children may be associated with a single parent. If a child have multiple parent/guardian associated with them, there should be functionality to send message to all parents associated with that child. It should be possible to access all necessary information about parents, such as their child(ren), contact info, and possibly other parents' info. This may be Would Like but Won't Have, depending on whether it would be possible to reference other IDs in the database. May require complex of forming the database schema. Feedback - Clarifications Admin should be able to inform emergency info such as schoolbus delay, not just app updates. Admin manages a school, and linGrow team would act as \"Super Admin\" of sort. Teachers contact parents, but cannot contact other teachers. Researchers contact participants, who may be teachers or parents. Researchers should be able to ask permission from teachers before they can be contacted, similar to teachers sending invites to parents. Researchers need separate hub compared to teachers. Researchers should have access to more permissions, and perhaps slightly different wordings. Miscellaneous Requirements Admin should be able to mass-create users from spreadsheet, rather than adding them one by one. Globe icon for language translation may be changed. Need some way of distinguishing children and parents. Teacher-parent chatrooms should have tags to distinguish which chatroom belongs to which school. Action Items All Teams Follow-through on the clients' clarifications, modify and update design diagrams if needed. Scheduled next client meeting on October 11, 2022. Prepare rough deliverables until then. October 7, 2022 6:00 PM - 6:54 PM Google Meet Agenda Update each others' progress. Form plans for next week before Sprint 2 duedate. Attendee Kash Loyal Jeff Scott Kevin Minutes Progress Reports Kash, Loyal Back-end framework for user account creation and authentication has been generated. Scott Researched Google translation API for the text message and website translation. Kevin, Jeff Wasn\u2019t able to get much work done over the week, but is aiming to get most works (on admin functions) done during weekend. Plan for Next Week Before client meeting next Tuesday (October 11, 2022), create rough front-end and back-end for demonstration. Before Sprint 2 due date on Saturday (October 15, 2022), deploy front- and back-end to Cybera instance. Action Items Kash, Loyal Deploy back-end framework to the Cybera instance. Sam, Steve, Scott Complete front-end mockup for the Sprint 2 - must contain login and signup functionalities. Jeff, Kevin Continue working on the CRUD functions for Admin's school groupings. Steve Update Story Map to be consistent with Github issues' user stories. October 10, 2022 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM Google Meet Agenda Progress check before client meeting on October 11, 2022. Identify what aspect the group must work on for the Sprint 2 deliverable. Attendee Kash Kevin Sam Steve Scott Minutes Progress Report - Frontend Sam, Steve, and Scott shared mock login screen, dashboard (home screen), and logout functionality. Sam modified frontend's user interface to be more aesthetically pleasing, and better modularized for future modifications. There are still bugs that needs to be fixed before Sprint 2. Should be possible to progress further once backend and frontend has been joined. Progress Report - Backend Loyal reported API endpoint for the user creation functionality, including user creation, user password reset (with automated email), user login. Kevin and Jeff are continuing to work on the admin functionality, but wasn\u2019t able to share the progress due to most of the work being done on Jeff\u2019s Github branch. Action Items All Teams Keep up the pace, continue bugfixes and work on integration of backend with frontend. October 11, 2022 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM Google Meet Agenda Update client on the team's current progress and obtain feedback. Attendee Dr. Andrea McLeod (Client) Dr. Catrine Demers (Client) Kevin Steve Loyal Sam Scott Kash Minutes Feedback - Software Design Informed clients on the modularity of some of the websites' designs (such as logo), and clarified the framework being used for the development of LinGrow - for the future modification if needed. Different homepages for different users - similar to the prototype provided in the beginning of the project - would be preferable. Clarified some of the requirements that will be worked on for future sprint, such as website translation, messaging functionality, and message translation. Feedback - Requirements User creation en-masse by the Admin using excel sheet is a must have. Activities should be accessible by all users, regardless of whether they are user of LinGrow or not. Would like an activity hub integrated within the LinGrow, but links leading to the activities page is sufficient for the project. https://bilingualacquisition.ca/covid-19-multilingual-families-talking-and-playing/ Action Items All Teams Schedule next meeting with the client once Sprint 2 is over - preferably in a timeframe where Jeff can also join. Stick to the assigned tasks, and complete Sprint 2 deliverable. October 14, 2022 7:00 PM - 10:25 PM Google Meet Agenda Final checkup for the current state of Sprint 2 deliverable. Triage of what requirements need to be satisfied before Sprint 2 due date. Attendee Kevin Scott Steve Jeff Loyal Kash Minutes Backend-Frontend Integration Integrated current working versions of the frontend with the API endpoints for users. Ensured that members participating in the meeting has fully functional back- and front-end on their local machine. Hackathon Remainder of the meeting was spent on modifying current codebase and test cases. Action Items Scott, Steve Ensure that issues relating to the frontend has been resolved by tomorrow, and all Sprint requirements are accounted for, including the test cases. Jeff, Kevin Generate test cases for admin and school management functionality API. Sam Update diagrams and documentation to reflect feedback from Sprint 1\u2019s documentation.
