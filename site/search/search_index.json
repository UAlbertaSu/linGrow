This language barrier would often prevent teachers from consulting with parents about their children\u2019s needs, and researchers from gaining a full understanding of bilingual development. LinGrow is the novel web app solution designed to bridge this gap between multilingual families and teachers/researchers. The heart of the LinGrow app is a messaging functionality between parents and teachers, with built-in translation supporting over 40 languages. This facilitates fast and easy communication between both parties, without the hassle of running everything through a separate service, or having the child relay and translate all information. To provide further support, LinGrow provides several built-in language development activities and simple English Guidelines to assist multilingual families. LinGrow aims to create a bridge of communication between parents, researchers and teachers, to overcome the language barrier and help children achieve their full potential.

Moses Open source translation system that utilizes statistical methods Strays very close to ML since it requires the training of the model. Complex model but should provide a better and more accurate translation than the API. method not recommended since it is a complex system and may be hard to expand later (adding more languages) Apertium Is a free/open-source platform for developing rule-based machine translation systems! Will most likely give the best translation since the developers set the rule for how each language syntax should be formed. The most work to use in terms of setting everything up.
